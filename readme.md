# Cuberto Home Page Clone

A clone of the Cuberto website home page, which is a UI/UX design agency. This project was built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Shery.js. It features various micro-interactions, animations, and 3D animations, helping me learn how to use most of the animation techniques available in Shery.js.

## Technologies Used
